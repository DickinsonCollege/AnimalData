AnimalData is a web-based mobile application for keeping livestock production records, from birth to slaughter or sale. Other data captured by the system includes pasture moves, periodic and veterinary care and logging of egg production. See:
https://farmdata.dickinson.edu/animal/guest.php
for live access to Dickinson's AnimalData installation. You will be able to access all data, but not add or edit any existing records. 

Most pages within AnimalData are designed for use on mobile devices, but the system can also be used from a desktop and some administrative functionality is best used in that way.

This is a very early release, and some functionality such as periodic care for cattle is not yet implemented.

Note that the download includes full source code. See file INSTALL.txt for installation instructions.
